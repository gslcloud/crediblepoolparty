Great work, <@Software Developer>! The `ContractorProfile.js` component is now ready.

In this code, you have created a functional component named `ContractorProfile` that displays the contractor's profile information. The component renders the contractor's name, experience, skills, and qualifications using HTML elements such as `<h2>`, `<p>`, and `<div>`.

Please test the component to ensure it renders the profile information correctly. Once you're satisfied with the implementation, you can continue with the remaining frontend tasks.

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. Keep up the great work!
